        break down the logic of a program into smaller functions that do one thing each. The
        program can then call these functions in sequence to perform the work.
        Write a program that prompts for a first name, last name, employee ID, and ZIP code.
        Ensure that the input is valid according to these rules:
            The first name must be filled in.
            The last name must be filled in.
            The first and last names must be at least two characters long.
            An employee ID is in the format AA-1234. So, two letters, a hyphen, and four numbers.
            The ZIP code must be a number.
            Display appropriate error messages on incorrect data.
        Example Output
            Enter the first name: J
            Enter the last name:
            Enter the ZIP code: ABCDE
            Enter an employee ID: A12-1234
            "J" is not a valid first name. It is too short.
            The last name must be filled in.
            The ZIP code must be numeric.
            A12-1234 is not a valid ID.
        Or
            Enter the first name: Jimmy
            Enter the last name: James
            Enter the ZIP code: 55555
            Enter an employee ID: TK-421
            There were no errors found.
        Constraints
            Create a function for each type of validation you need to write. Then create
            a validateInput function that takes in all of the input data and invokes the
            specific validation functions.
            Use a single output statement to display the outputs.*/

        String output = readUserInput();
        System.out.print(output);
