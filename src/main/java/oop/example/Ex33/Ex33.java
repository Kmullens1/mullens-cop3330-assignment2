        /*Arrays are great for storing possible responses from a program. If you
        combine that with a random number generator, you can pick a random entry
        from this list, which works great for games.
        Create a Magic 8 Ball game that prompts for a question and then displays
        either "Yes," "No,""Maybe," or "Ask again later."
        Example Output
        What's your question?
        Will I be rich and famous?
        Ask again later.
                Constraint
        The value should be chosen randomly using a pseudo random number generator.
        Store the possible choices in a list and select one at random.*/
