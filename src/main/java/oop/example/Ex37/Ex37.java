        /*Coming up with a password that meets specific requirements is something
        your computer can do.And it will give you practice using random number
        generators in conjunction with a list of known values.
        Create a program that generates a secure password. Prompt the user for the
        minimum length, the number of special characters, and the number of numbers.
        Then generate a password for the user using those inputs.
        Example Output
            What's the minimum length? 8
            How many special characters? 2
            How many numbers? 2
            Your password is aurn2$1s#
        Constraints
            Use lists to store the characters youâ€™ll use to generate the passwords.
            Add some randomness to the password generation.*/
